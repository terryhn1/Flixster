### Notes

I tried to use the Glide third-party library for transformation, and synced my Android Studio. Somehow, it didn't know what transform() method was so I left it as is.

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
As this was the one of first experiences with Android Studio, attribute options were complex at first. However, by looking at the names and just testing them out, I became more comfortable in experimenting at the UI functionalitites. The process of RecyclerView became more comfortable to deal with as I could see the patterns that always came with using them. I still haven't looked into how to make sure that text can be hidden in the case that getText() is too much for the textBox to handle, so that will be another part I would like to try to learn later on.
